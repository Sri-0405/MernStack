# MernStack
Designed and developed a responsive web application using the MERN stack for booking and managing restaurant reservations. Implemented RESTful APIs with Express.js and Node.js, and used MongoDB for data persistence. Integrated a clean React UI with form validation and Tailwind CSS for a user-friendly experience.
